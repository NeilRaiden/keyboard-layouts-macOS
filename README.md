## Phonemic layouts

These keyboard layouts are designed for writing in English phonemically, using either the IPA notation or the Shavian Alphabet.
All the phonemic layouts are compatible with Shavian QWERTY, thus may also be used for learning typing in the Shavian Alphabet.

### US phonemic

Designed for typing English phonemically, specifically using General American (GA) phonemes.
The layout is very simiar to the "UK rhotic" except that the long vowels and the R-colored vowels are shortened:
⟨ɜr⟩, ⟨ər⟩, ⟨ɑr⟩, ⟨ɔr⟩, ⟨er⟩, ⟨ɪər⟩.

### UK phonemic

Designed for typing English phonemically, specifically using Received Pronunciation (RP) phonemes.
The R-colored vowels are distinguished by subscript "r" ⟨ʳ⟩:
⟨ɜːʳ⟩, ⟨əʳ⟩, ⟨ɑːʳ⟩, ⟨ɔːʳ⟩, ⟨eəʳ⟩, ⟨ɪəʳ⟩.

### UK rhotic

Designed for typing English phonemically, specifically using Received Pronunciation (RP) phonemes.
The R-colored vowels are distinguished by retular "r" ⟨r⟩:
⟨ɜːr⟩, ⟨ər⟩, ⟨ɑːr⟩, ⟨ɔːr⟩, ⟨eər⟩, ⟨ɪər⟩.

### Differences between US and UK notations:

|  UK  | UK rhotic |  US  |
|:----:|:---------:|:----:|
|  ɑː  |    ɑː     |  ɑ   |
|  ɔː  |    ɔː     |  ɔ   |
|  uː  |    uː     |  u   |
|  iː  |    iː     |  i   |
|  ɑːʳ |    ɑːr    |  ɑr  |
|  ɔːʳ |    ɔːr    |  ɔr  |
|  ɜːʳ |    ɜːr    |  ɜr  |
|  əʊ  |    əʊ     |  ɔʊ  |
|  ʊəʳ |    ʊər    |  ʊr  |
|  eəʳ |    eər    |  er  |

## Other layouts

### ESL

> ESL = English as a Second Language

The ESL keyboard layout contains all English phoneme symbols in layers 3 (Option+key).
This layout might be useful for ESL teachers who may need occasionally use these symbols.

Layer 3 (Option+key):
 - consonants: ɡ, θ, ð, ʃ, ʒ, ʧ, ʤ, ʍ, ɫ, ɹ, ŋ
	- _note that ⟨ɡ⟩ (U+0261) is the IPA symbol for "g" (U+67)_
 - vowels: ə, ʌ, ɪ, ʊ, ɔ, ɑ, ɒ, æ, ɛ, ɜ, ɐ
 - accent marks: ˈˌ
 - math angle brakets that are often used to enclose phoneme symbols: ⟨⟩
 - aditional phonetic marks: ʰ, ᵊ, ʔ

Layer 4 (Option+Shift+key):
 - two R-colored vowels: ɝ, ɚ
 - aditional phonetic marks: ʳ, ɾ
 - also, combining diacritical marks (combining with the previous symbol):
	- ⌥n  - ◌̃ (U+0303) combining tilde /ˈtɪldə/ (nasalisation)
	- ⌥⇧w - ◌̀ (U+0300) combining grave accent /ɡreɪv/ or /ɡrɑːv/
	- ⌥⇧e - ◌́ (U+0301) combining acute accent
	- ⌥⇧f - ◌̄ (U+0304) combining macron /ˈmækrɒn/
	- ⌥⇧g - ◌̱ (U+0331) combining macron below

### ASERTH

The ASERT layout is very similar to widely known Colemak-DH layout, designed for people who are already proficient with the QWERTY layout, in order to expedite learning.

This layout is based on [QWERTY-Flip-Twist](https://github.com/nick-gravgaard/qwerty-flip>QWERTY-Flip-Twist) by Nick Gravgaard.
The **AltGr** and **AltGr+Shift** layers are similar to the **Writer** layout.

Total of 14 keys relocated according to scheme:

* flip **ERT** with **DFG**
* flip **N** with **J**, **K** with **I**
* twist: **L → ; → P → O → L**

This layout (ASERTH or QWERTY-flip-twist) focus on **reducing the learning curve** while being *almost* as efficient as Colemak.

### Writer

The US-Writer layout adds punctuation marks to layers 3 (Option+key) and 4 (Option+Shift+key): 
 - 66-99 and 6-9 quotation marks: “” and ‘’
 - ellipsis: …
 - hyphen and non-breaking hyphen: ‐ and ‑
 - N-dash and M-dash: – and —
 - guillemets: «» and ‹›
 - bullets: •◦⁃○·
 - copyright, trademark, etc symbols: ©®™℗
 - superscript numbers: ⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹
 - subscript numbers: ₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉
 - arrows: →←↑↓
 - 
> Many of the punctuation marks above are required by writing style guides and are in common use in all newspapers, books etc — and yet they are absent from most keyboard layouts.
