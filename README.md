## Other layouts

### ESL

> ESL = English as a Second Language

The ESL keyboard layout contains all English phoneme symbols in layers 3 (Option+key).
This layout might be useful for ESL teachers who may need occasionally use these symbols.

Layer 3 (Option+key):
 - consonants: ɡ, θ, ð, ʃ, ʒ, ʧ, ʤ, ʍ, ɫ, ɹ, ŋ
	- _note that ⟨ɡ⟩ (U+0261) is the IPA symbol for "g" (U+67)_
 - vowels: ə, ʌ, ɪ, ʊ, ɔ, ɑ, ɒ, æ, ɛ, ɜ, ɐ
 - accent marks: ˈˌ
 - math angle brakets that are often used to enclose phoneme symbols: ⟨⟩
 - aditional phonetic marks: ʰ, ᵊ, ʔ

Layer 4 (Option+Shift+key):
 - two R-colored vowels: ɝ, ɚ
 - aditional phonetic marks: ʳ, ɾ
 - also, combining diacritical marks (combining with the previous symbol):
	- ⌥n  - ◌̃ (U+0303) combining tilde /ˈtɪldə/ (nasalisation)
	- ⌥⇧w - ◌̀ (U+0300) combining grave accent /ɡreɪv/ or /ɡrɑːv/
	- ⌥⇧e - ◌́ (U+0301) combining acute accent
	- ⌥⇧f - ◌̄ (U+0304) combining macron /ˈmækrɒn/
	- ⌥⇧g - ◌̱ (U+0331) combining macron below

### ASERT

The ASERT layout is very similar to widely known Colemak-DH layout, designed for people who are already proficient with the QWERTY layout, in order to expedite learning.


### Writer

The US-Writer layout adds punctuation marks to layers 3 (Option+key) and 4 (Option+Shift+key): 
 - 66-99 and 6-9 quotation marks: “” and ‘’
 - ellipsis: …
 - hyphen and non-breaking hyphen: ‐ and ‑
 - N-dash and M-dash: – and —
 - guillemets: «» and ‹›
 - bullets: •◦⁃○·
 - copyright, trademark, etc symbols: ©®™℗
 - superscript numbers: ⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹
 - subscript numbers: ₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉
 - arrows: →←↑↓
 - 
> Many of the punctuation marks above are required by writing style guides and are in common use in all newspapers, books etc — and yet they are absent from most keyboard layouts.
